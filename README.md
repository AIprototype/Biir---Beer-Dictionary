# Biir---Beer-Dictionary
A simple native android application using MVVM architecture and Paging adapter to view beer details from the famous 'Punk API V2'

It uses MVVM architecture, along with the latest paging adapter 3. The 2 fragments are connected using the navigation graph of the navigation component. For API calls I have used coroutines along with coroutine flow to allow for uninterrupted flow of data from api.

Dev stack used:
Kotlin
Dagger 2
Data Binding
Coroutines/Flow
MVVM architecture
